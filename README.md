A UDP interface for Beam.Pro, if that makes sense

When a UDP packet is sent to it, it responds with the ID of a button that is next on its queue. I put this together so that I can accept Beam.Pro input in lua script. Lua script is built-in to many emulators, meaning essentially you can emulate games that interact with Beam.Pro. Pretty cool.
